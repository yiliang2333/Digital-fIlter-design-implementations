# Digital-fIlter-design-implementations-
This repo contains some examples of some digital filters I tryed myself. Hope to discuss this with you.
## FilterSplit.m & myroots_dk.m & mypolyval.m
This function is to implement **tf2sos** function and the core part is the ***root*** function which I also implemented using the Durand-Kerner method.
## Butter.c
A self-created function to achieve a maximum 8-order Butterworth filter in C.
## Bessel 
1-5 order Bessel filter is implemented based on python scipy library and the definition in Wikipedia using Matlab.
